This repository contains python code in a Jupyter notebook for performing analysis on school performance by various data elements available in the CSV files provided.  

The following is the resulting analysis:

PyCity Schools Analysis

Schools in PyCity have wide range of achievement in reading and math. An analysis of the schools found variances in school type, school size, budget per student.

* The data showed that higher spending per student was not correlated with higher achievement. The schools with the least spending per student had a 90% overall passing rates, whereas schools with the highest spending per student had the lowest overall passing rates, averaging only 53%.

* Larger schools fared worse than smaller schools. Schools with fewer than 2000 students had an overall passing rate of 90%, whereas larger schools averaged a 58% passing rate.

* Charter schools had higher passing rates than district schools, as well â€“ with 90% of the charter students passing vs. 54% of the district schools passing.

One might look at this data and conclude that smaller charter schools with less spending have better outcomes. However, further analysis is required, because none of the schools showed appreciable changes in reading or math test scores for students as they progressed from 9th through 12th grades. If one category of school was appreciably more or less effective, one would expect to see student achievement either improve or degrade over the 4-year period.

Please note the following table showing the average reading scores by grade, as an example:
